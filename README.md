# Final-Project-

Project description 
    This Final Project is a Bar inventory system. The use of this java-based application is to allow a Bar to have an inventory of a variety of cocktails that they sell and the quantity of each cocktail that the are allowed to sell. This system is meant for nightly inventory. 
    It lets users:
        Input the available drinks that can be sold that night.
        Input the cocktails that have been sold 
        View available and sold-out drinks 
        Save and load cocktail information using text files

Instructions for runnig the program 
    Compile the program using javac *.java
    Run it with Main java

Examples of program ussage 
    Option 1 can be used to view inventory for available and sold out drinks 
    Option 2 is used to add variety of cocktails and quantity of each 
    Option 3 is used to input what cocktails have been sold
    Option 4 is used to save what cokatail were added and sold. It is also used to exit the program 

Known limitation or future improvements 
    This is a relatively simple and primitive way for a bar to manage its inventory. Future improvements could include creating additional classes to represent which liquors are used in particular cocktails. This would allow the system to better anticipate how many bottles of each liquor the bar needs each night.
    Sold out list can hold up to 50 lines of drinks
